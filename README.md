# A Killer Vue.js Blog Demo: Launch in 2 Hours Tops

![vuejs-blog-demo](https://snipcart.com/media/175864/build-vuejs-blog-copy.jpg)

In this demo, I'm going to provide an open source Vue.js blog demo + cover.

Steps:

- Setup and routing
- Displaying your blog feed with filters
- Displaying individual posts with comments
- Creating a custom Vue plugin to keep your data decoupled

The result will be a JAMstack-ready, truly decoupled Vue blog you can plug to any data sourceâ€”more on that later.
